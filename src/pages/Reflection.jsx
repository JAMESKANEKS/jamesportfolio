      <p>My journey in Information Technology has been a meaningful process of growth, discovery, and continuous learning. From my first year up to my fourth year of study, I gradually developed not only my technical skills but also my discipline, patience, and problem-solving mindset.

In the beginning, I was introduced to the basic concepts of programming, computer systems, and web development. At first, many topics were challenging, and I often made mistakes while writing code. However, through consistent practice, guidance from instructors, and self-study, I learned how to understand errors, debug programs, and improve my logic step by step.

As I progressed, I gained experience in building websites and simple applications. I learned the importance of clean code, proper planning, and user-centered design. Working on projects helped me understand how theory is applied in real-world scenarios, and how teamwork, communication, and time management play a big role in successful development.

My experience as a freelance web developer further shaped my confidence and responsibility. Handling client requirements taught me how to listen carefully, manage deadlines, and deliver quality output. Each project, whether small or complex, became an opportunity to improve my technical skills and professional attitude.

Looking back, I am proud of how far I have come. This journey taught me that learning in IT never stops. I remain dedicated to improving my skills, learning new technologies, and growing as a professional who can contribute positively to the industry and to every organization I work with.</p>
